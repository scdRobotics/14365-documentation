Welcome to FTC Team 14365 - Summit Knight's Documentation!
==========================================================

**Who is this intended for?**

   This is meant for current or perspective programmers on Team 14365 to learn from and use as a reference, written during the 2022-2023 season for use during the 2023-2024 season.

**Who wrote this?**

   This was written by Logan Miller, team captain and lead programmer who graduated in 2023.

   You can contact him with any questions at loganmiller5505@gmail.com or MillerBoys5589#4424 on Discord.

**How is this best used?**

   It is designed to pair well with the [**WIP, ADD HYPERLINK WHEN DONE**] "tutorial-exercises" project on the scdRobotics GitHub account for more hands on, involved activities to see the code in action and gain hands-on experiences and concrete reference programs.

Check out the :doc:`downloads` section for all the software you need on your own computer to begin programming, with the :doc:`setup` section describing how to setup a project you can then install onto the robot.

Each additional section will focus on some aspect of the robot's control, each containing "Overview", "Examples", and "Implementation" sections.

.. note::

   This project is under active development. It is planned to be complete by *Monday, March 20th*.
