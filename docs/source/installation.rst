Installation
============

.. _androidstudio:

Android Studio
--------------
Android Studio is the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that you will do a vast majority of your standard programming in. It is a very powerful tool that checks syntax as you code and allows you to connect with the Control Hub on the Robot, which then runs the programs.

The latest installation executable (with a guide built in) can be found 'here <https://developer.android.com/studio>'_

.. _githubdesktop:

GitHub Desktop
---------------
GitHub Desktop is a Git application which makes managing version control much easier. While Android Studio has a built in Git application, I prefer GitHub Desktop for its simplicity, which tends to help avoid breaking workflows.

The latest installation executable (with a guide built in) can be found 'here <https://desktop.github.com/>'_. You will need to create a GitHub account before proceeding!
